# MARC Tools

MARCS are a pain. 

These tools make some basic tasks quicker/easier to do. 

On windows, the advised use case is adding the folder that contains these scripts to your environment path and creating batch files for each one. This then allows you to quickly copy the folder location and then run whichever script by pressing win+r and typing the script name and any necessary command line arguements. 

There are known issues with split_marc_by_eisbn.py when working with older or faulty files. These scripts were put together quickly to assist with my marc tasks at work, and generally I have found it easier to just use the excellent MARC edit (the go to "MARC" based software) when working with older files.
